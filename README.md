# Redux quiz group project

This project has been done in collaboration between Naghmeh Okhovat, Elin Segelöv, Petra Söderström, Younas Tesfamariam and Julia Östedt. For week ten of the Technigo bootcamp (first week working with Redux) our assignment was to create a quiz and displaying the provided answers is a summary. We were given a starter code with reducers and actions.

## The problem
To complete the task we planed using a Kanban board, breaking down the assignment in smaller parts. We have mostly been mob- or pair-programming.
The project has is styled using Styled components.
